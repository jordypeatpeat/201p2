# 201 Project 2 - Looking Glass

So I've been forgetting to upload to github, so I've got my first commit here!

I haven't made much progress at all, just added the map page using the MDL (Material Design Lite) framework. The sections for each extra page such as Profile, Upload and Statistics are working right now using a jquery slideToggle function.
